<img src="assets/images/Cover.png" alt="Cover" title="AI2E Cover" />
This repository includes material relating to the online program AI Everytime Everywhere (AI2E) of School of AI Algiers.  It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various machine learning and deep learning topics. In these tutorials, we will guide you through the different steps of creating a machine learning application, from collecting the data to choosing the model and finally deploying it. 

During this journey, you'll discover many ML concepts and practice your acquired knowledge through different challenges and exercises.

## Dependencies 
Although we will dedicate one workshop session to discovering the tools, this section helps you install all the necessary requirements to execute all the notebooks. 

### Install and Manage your Anaconda Environment 

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an open source package management system. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

Using Anaconda consists of the following:
1. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your computer, by selecting the latest Python version for your operating system. If you already have `conda` or `miniconda` installed, you should be able to skip this step and move on to step 2.
2. Create an anaconda environment using the environment.yml file included in this repository. ``` conda env create -f environment.yml ``` 

Note that the documentation of Anaconda is really useful, just check this [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). 

#### 1. Installation

**Download** the latest version of `miniconda` that matches your system.

|        | Linux | Mac | Windows | 
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| 64-bit | [64-bit (bash installer)][lin64] | [64-bit (bash installer)][mac64] | [64-bit (exe installer)][win64]
| 32-bit | [32-bit (bash installer)][lin32] |  | [32-bit (exe installer)][win32]

[win64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
[win32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86.exe
[mac64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
[lin64]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
[lin32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86.sh

**Install** [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your machine. Detailed instructions:
