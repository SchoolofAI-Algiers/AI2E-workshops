To start our journey in the best way possible, we will get to know the tools we're going to work with : Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook. We will conclude this workshop by going through a small algerian dataset and getting to know interesting python packages that will help us explore the datasets and study them. \n",

    "## 1. What is Anaconda ? \n",
    "\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a distribution of packages built for data science. It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions of Python and/or different packages. You'll also use it to install, uninstall, and update packages in your environments. Using Anaconda has made my life working with data much more pleasant. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working on different projects on the same computer you come across a pretty complicated issue where 2 projects use the same package but in 2 separate versions (For example Pytorch 0.4 VS Pytorch 1.0). One solution is to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). It lets you create two isolated Python environment for each project. \n",
    "Although virtualenv works even for data science projects, in this situation Anaconda is the way to go. It is specifically built for Data projects. "
